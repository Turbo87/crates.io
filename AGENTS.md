## General Guidance

- Read `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for comprehensive setup instructions and contribution guidelines.
- Use `cargo insta accept` instead of `cargo insta review` when updating snapshot tests.
- Use `#[expect(...)]` instead of `#[allow(...)]` to silence warnings that should be resolved later.
- Match existing code style within each area (backend Rust follows workspace lints, frontend follows ESLint/Prettier config).
- Add documentation comments to new types and functions; existing code may lack comments, but new code should have them.

## Backend

### Building and Running

Run the API server:

```bash
cargo run
```

Run the background worker:

```bash
cargo run --bin background-worker
```

Database migrations:

```bash
diesel migration run              # Apply pending migrations
diesel migration revert           # Revert last migration
diesel migration redo             # Revert and reapply last migration
diesel migration generate <name>  # Create new migration
```

Admin CLI (check crate ownership, manage users, etc.):

```bash
cargo run --bin crates-admin -- <subcommand>
```

### Testing

Run backend tests (with separate test database):

```bash
cargo test
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
cargo test <test_name>
```

Accept updated snapshot tests:

```bash
cargo insta accept --workspace
```

Check code quality:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check                                # Formatting
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace  # Linting
```

Test database setup: Set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to a separate database (e.g., `postgres://postgres@localhost/cargo_registry_test`). The test harness creates isolated databases and runs migrations automatically. Create the base test database once with `createdb cargo_registry_test`.

### Architecture and Conventions

- Use Axum web framework patterns (handlers, extractors, middleware).
- Follow Diesel ORM patterns for database queries; see models in `crates/crates_io_database/src/models/`.
- Use `anyhow::Result` for fallible operations; use `thiserror` for domain-specific error types.
- Background jobs go in `/src/worker/jobs/` and must implement the `Job` trait from `crates_io_worker`. Jobs must be idempotent.
- Controllers return responses via helper functions in `/src/util/` for consistent serialization.
- Use snapshot testing with `insta` for API responses.
- Never ignore deprecation warnings; fix them immediately or use `#[expect(deprecated)]`.
- Rate limiting configuration lives in `/src/rate_limiter.rs`; new endpoints should use appropriate limiters.
- Structured logging uses `tracing`; add spans for request context.
- Authentication happens via session cookies (web users) or API tokens (cargo CLI, third-party clients).
- OpenAPI spec: Auto-generated from backend code; update by running `cargo test --package crates_io --lib openapi` and accepting the snapshot changes.

## Frontend

### Building and Running

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm playwright install chromium-headless-shell  # Install necessary Playwright browsers
```

Development server options:

```bash
pnpm start:live      # Use production crates.io backend
pnpm start:staging   # Use staging backend
pnpm start:local     # Use local backend (requires backend setup)
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test                              # Run QUnit tests
pnpm ember test --filter="<test_name>" # Run specific QUnit test
pnpm e2e                               # Run Playwright tests
pnpm e2e <test_file>                   # Run specific Playwright test
```

Code quality:

```bash
pnpm lint:js         # JavaScript linting
pnpm lint:hbs        # Template linting
pnpm lint:deps       # Dependency linting
pnpm prettier:check  # Check formatting
pnpm prettier:write  # Fix formatting
```

### Architecture and Conventions

- Follow Ember Octane conventions: Glimmer components, tracked properties, GJS files.
- Components use scoped CSS via `ember-scoped-css`; styles go in `<ComponentName>.css`.
- Data fetching happens in routes via `model()` hooks; use Ember Data models for API communication.
- Use services for shared state (session, notifications, progress tracking).
- Accessibility is critical; use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and test with `ember-a11y-testing`.
- MSW mocks for tests live in `/packages/crates-io-msw/`; define handlers for API endpoints.
- Visual regression testing uses Percy; screenshots are captured automatically in CI.
- Follow existing component patterns for consistency; search for similar components before creating new ones.

## Commit Messages and Pull Requests

Use present tense imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Remove", "Use", "Implement", "Extract"). Include scope prefixes when relevant, for example:

- `trustpub:` for trusted publishing changes
- `jobs/<job_name>:` for background jobs
- `controllers/<area>:` for controller changes

Use backticks for code elements: `function_name()`, `StructName`, `ModuleName`.

Examples:

- "Use `#[expect(deprecated)]` to silence `generic-array` deprecations"
- "Fix dropdown indicator color in dark mode"
- "trustpub: Derive `Clone` for claims structs"
- "jobs/analyze_crate_file: Schedule OG image rerender after analysis"
- "Extract `validate_tarball()` fn"
- "Implement `Display` for `ErrorKind`"

Keep first line under 72 characters. Be direct and technical; omit unnecessary articles. For complex changes, add a commit body explaining the reasoning.

Pull requests run CI checks: backend tests, frontend tests, ESLint, Prettier, rustfmt, and clippy. Fix issues before merging. The `main` branch auto-deploys to staging; production deployments are manual promotions.

## Review Checklist

Before submitting:

- Run `cargo fmt --all` and `pnpm prettier:write` depending on the changed files for consistent formatting.
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix warnings.
- Run `cargo test` and `pnpm test` depending on the changed files; all tests must pass.
- Accept snapshot changes with `cargo insta accept` if expected.
- Check that new backend functions/types have documentation comments.
- Verify frontend changes work with `pnpm start:live` against production data.
- Ensure database migrations are reversible (test with `diesel migration redo`).
- Confirm error messages are actionable and don't expose sensitive information.
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen reader landmarks.
